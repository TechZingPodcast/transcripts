[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.300]   Now
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.380]  ,
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.450]   I
[00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.840]   guess

[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.000]  
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.210]   So
[00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.300]   I
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.550]   very
[00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.410]   much

[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.120]   So
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.690]   initially
[00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.810]  ,
[00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:59.120]   those

[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.590]   guess
[00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.660]  ,

[00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:05.000]  .
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.180]   Now
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.300]  ,
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.540]   this
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.660]   is
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.720]   a
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.960]   word

[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.000]  .
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.250]   But
[00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.420]   it
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.580]  's
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.340]   basically
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.590]   the
