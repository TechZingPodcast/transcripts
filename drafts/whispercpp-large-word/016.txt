[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:32.020]   and
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:32.100]   we
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:32.220]   are
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:32.300]   in
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:32.520]   their

[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:33.060]  .
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:33.140]   -
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:33.560]   Well
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:33.600]  ,
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:33.830]   let
[00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:34.040]   me
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:34.390]   build
[00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.580]   up
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:34.790]   the

[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:36.180]  .
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:36.490]   So
[00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:36.960]   his
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.590]   idea

[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:39.830]   where
[00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:39.940]   we
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:40.210]  're
[00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:40.660]   plugged

[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:40.660]  .
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:40.850]   It

[00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.940]   we
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:42.130]  're
[00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:42.380]   just
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:42.690]   part
[00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:42.740]   of

[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:43.660]   simulation
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:43.990]   like

[00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:44.520]  ,
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:44.870]   like
[00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.990]   the
[00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.700]   characters
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:46.130]   inside
[00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:46.540]   Sims
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:46.610]  ,
[00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:47.010]   yeah
[00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:47.060]  ?
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:47.420]   Okay
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:47.600]  ,
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:47.780]   so
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:48.140]   then
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:48.320]   he
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:48.680]   says
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:48.900]  ,
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:49.080]   okay
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:49.180]  ,
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:49.390]   so
[00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:50.250]   assuming
[00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:50.700]   that
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:50.700]  ,
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:50.930]   now
[00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:51.080]   we
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:51.430]   have

[00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.480]   of
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:53.860]   these
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:54.040]   is
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:54.510]   most
[00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:55.150]   probably

[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:55.770]  ,
[00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:56.460]   right
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:56.460]  ?
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:56.480]  
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:56.770]   But
[00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:57.120]   if
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:57.310]   you
[00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:57.950]   assume
[00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:58.370]   that

[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:00.420]  ,
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:00.600]   then
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:00.730]   you
[00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:00.930]   come
[00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:01.000]   up
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.180]   with
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:01.590]   something

[00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:02.260]  .
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:02.430]   So
[00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:02.690]   the

[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:06.500]   I
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:06.690]   think

[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:10.600]   but
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:10.950]   this
[00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:11.140]   is
