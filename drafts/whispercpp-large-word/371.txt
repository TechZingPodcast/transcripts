[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:36.370]   So
[01:41:36.370 --> 01:41:37.170]   obviously
[01:41:37.170 --> 01:41:37.380]   it
[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:37.640]  's
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:38.230]   really
[01:41:38.230 --> 01:41:39.000]   good
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  .
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:39.150]   The
[01:41:39.150 --> 01:41:39.710]   information
[01:41:39.710 --> 01:41:39.810]   it
[01:41:39.810 --> 01:41:40.060]   gives

[01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:40.840]   good
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:41.000]  .
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:41.080]   I
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:41.490]   think
[01:41:41.490 --> 01:41:41.970]   that
[01:41:41.970 --> 01:41:42.050]  ,
[01:41:42.050 --> 01:41:42.150]   I
[01:41:42.150 --> 01:41:42.490]   think
[01:41:42.490 --> 01:41:42.700]   you
[01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:43.270]   could
[01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.270]  ,
[01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.410]   I
[01:41:43.410 --> 01:41:43.820]   think
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:44.000]   you
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:44.410]   could
[01:41:44.410 --> 01:41:44.650]   and
[01:41:44.650 --> 01:41:45.130]   should
[01:41:45.130 --> 01:41:45.620]   take
[01:41:45.620 --> 01:41:45.680]   it
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:46.190]   further
[01:41:46.190 --> 01:41:46.350]   in
[01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:46.420]   a
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:47.000]   way
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  .
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:47.540]   And
[01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:47.720]   I
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:48.820]   just
[01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:49.160]   want
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:49.950]   to
[01:41:49.950 --> 01:41:50.240]   show
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:50.780]   you
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:52.590]   something
[01:41:52.590 --> 01:41:53.000]  .
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:53.490]   So
[01:41:53.490 --> 01:41:53.570]   this
[01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:53.760]   is
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:53.950]   an
[01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:54.620]   example
[01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:54.810]   of

[01:41:59.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:41:59.220]   So
[01:41:59.220 --> 01:41:59.290]   if
[01:41:59.290 --> 01:41:59.410]   we
