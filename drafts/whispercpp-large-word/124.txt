[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:45.110]   So
[01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.180]   I
[01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:45.670]   think

[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:48.290]   And
[01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:48.660]   then
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:48.760]   I
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:49.310]   guess
[01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.480]   the

[01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:50.900]   step
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:51.050]   is
[01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:51.220]   then
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:51.310]   to
[01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:51.580]   think
[01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:51.790]   like
[01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:51.940]  ,
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:52.040]   okay
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:52.100]  ,
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:52.260]   well
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:52.260]  ,
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:52.390]   how
[01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:52.520]   can
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:52.650]   you
[01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:52.780]   use
[01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:52.860]   it
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:52.940]   as
