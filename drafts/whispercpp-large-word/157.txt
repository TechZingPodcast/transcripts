[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:17.100]  
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:17.110]   So
[00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:17.310]   that
[00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:17.460]   was

[00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.440]   we
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:23.650]   spend

[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:24.370]   just
[00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:24.790]   thinking
