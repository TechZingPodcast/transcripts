[00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.480]  .
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.670]   But
[00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.240]   my
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250]   family

[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.130]   over
[00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.300]   to
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.610]   spend
[00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.680]   a

[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.680]  ,
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.810]   so
[00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.000]   she
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.390]   wanted

[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.080]   So

[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.360]   they
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.810]   looked

[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.680]  .
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.860]   So
