[00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:14.990]  ,
[00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.290]   the
[00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:15.640]   kids
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.120]   really
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:16.550]   light
[00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:16.720]   up
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.000]  .
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.160]   And
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:17.210]   I
[00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:17.520]   think
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:17.700]   that
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:17.970]   would
[00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:18.190]   pull
[00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.410]   them
[00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:18.660]   into
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.000]   really
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:19.470]   thinking
[00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:19.700]   hard
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.000]   about
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   how
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   they
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   want
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:20.350]   their
[00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:20.700]   robot
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:20.840]   to
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.260]   behave
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:21.470]   and
[00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.680]   how
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:21.820]   to
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:22.100]   make
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:22.240]   it
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:22.730]   smarter
[00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:23.000]  .
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:23.130]   And
[00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:23.420]   then
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:23.430]   I
[00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.700]   think
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:23.790]   we
[00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:24.060]   could
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:24.270]   even
[00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.430]   get
[00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:24.640]   into
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.040]   simple
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:25.450]   artificial
[00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:26.000]   intelligence
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   stuff
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.000]  ,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.300]   like
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:26.760]   simple
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.370]   decision
[00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:27.670]   tree
[00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:28.290]   learners
[00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:28.520]   and
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.000]   things
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.000]  .
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.240]   Because
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:29.300]   they
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:29.380]  're
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:29.550]   going

[00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:29.620]   be
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:29.810]   wanting
[00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:29.860]   it
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:30.000]  .
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.330]   Like
[00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:30.490]  ,
[00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:30.820]   well
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:30.980]  ,
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:31.250]   how
[00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:31.390]   do
[00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:31.470]   I
[00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:31.720]   get
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:31.880]   my
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.290]   robot
[00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:32.450]   to
[00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:32.780]   know
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:32.930]   where
[00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:33.770]   the
[00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:33.770]   gold
[00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:34.000]   is
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.000]  ?
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.070]   I
[00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.500]   really
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:34.790]   like
[00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:35.000]   the
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:35.210]   way
[00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:35.500]   that
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:35.740]   you
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:36.080]   built

[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:36.710]   course
[00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:37.000]  .
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.180]   So
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:37.720]   what
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:37.960]   Jason
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:38.220]   did
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:38.480]   was
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:38.650]   he
[00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:39.090]   built
[00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:39.170]   a
[00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:40.000]   situation
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:40.450]   where
[00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:40.540]   a
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:41.040]   robot
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:41.140]   had
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:41.230]   to
[00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.320]   go
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:41.650]   through
[00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:41.690]   a
[00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:42.000]   course
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.000]  ,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.000]  
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.220]   but
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:42.840]   actually
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.180]   there
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:43.400]   was

[00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:45.130]  ,
[00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:45.470]   and
[00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.590]   each
[00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:46.000]   course
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   was

[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:46.000]  .
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:46.150]   So
[00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:46.360]   you
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:46.610]   had
[00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:46.740]   to
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.140]   write

[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   one
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.290]   and
[00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:50.670]   then
[00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:50.960]   use
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.240]   the
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:51.630]   same

[00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:54.000]   logic
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.230]   to
[00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.270]   then
[00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:54.400]   get
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:54.820]   through
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.000]   course
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   two
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:55.000]  ,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:55.260]   which
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:55.410]   was

[00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:57.000]  .
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:57.120]   So
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:57.240]   it
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:57.610]   really
