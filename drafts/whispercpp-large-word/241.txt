[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:20.240]   you
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:20.340]   did
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:20.580]   suggest
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:20.720]   that

[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:21.670]   Yeah
[00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:22.000]  .
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:22.000]  
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:22.030]   -
[00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:22.120]   But
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:22.180]   it
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:22.420]   probably
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:22.570]   does

[00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:23.000]  .
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:23.190]   So
[00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.520]   anyway
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:23.670]  ,
[00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:23.780]   so
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:23.910]   we
[00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:24.100]  're
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:24.230]  ,
[00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.820]   although
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:24.840]   I
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.150]   think
[00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:25.690]   Jeremy
[00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:25.840]   may
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.000]   have
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.310]   said
[00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.390]   it
[00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.520]   as
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:26.800]   well
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.000]  ,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:27.310]   but
[00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:27.840]   anyway
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.130]  ,
[00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.400]   it
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.000]   was
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:29.050]   a
[00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:29.270]   good
[00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:29.820]   suggestion
[00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:30.000]  .
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:30.130]   So
[00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:30.540]   anyway
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:30.680]  ,
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:30.800]   we
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.130]   built
[00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:31.400]   it
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:31.410]  ,
[00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:31.850]   right
[00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:32.000]  ?
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.120]   So
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:32.330]   the
[00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:32.490]   way
[00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:32.710]   that
[00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.900]   the
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:33.440]   algorithm
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:33.680]   that
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:33.800]   we
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.040]   used
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:34.210]  ,
[00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:34.390]   and
[00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.580]   this
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:34.690]   is
[00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:34.880]   the
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.230]   dirty
[00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:35.540]   little
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:35.780]   hack
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:36.000]  .
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.120]   So
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:36.670]   basically
[00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:36.780]  ,
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:37.320]   obviously
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:37.440]  ,
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:37.810]   these
[00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:38.160]   tablets
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:38.340]   may
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:38.480]   be
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:38.820]   online
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:38.940]   or
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:39.120]   may
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:39.300]   not
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:39.420]   be
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:39.780]   online
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:40.000]  .
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.110]   So
[00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:40.220]   we
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:40.560]   needed
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:40.710]   to
[00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.790]   be
[00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:41.140]   purely
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:41.430]   based
[00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.540]   on

[00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:42.000]  .
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.170]   So
[00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:42.510]   what
[00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:42.810]   we
[00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:42.930]  're

[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:43.520]   is
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:43.690]   we
[00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:44.070]   want
[00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.200]   it
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:44.370]   to
[00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:44.540]   be

[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:45.290]  dig
[00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:45.590]  it
[00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.800]   code
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.140]   with
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:46.700]   four

[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:47.220]  ,
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:47.960]   right
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.000]  ?
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:48.000]
