[01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:10.320]   It
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:10.400]   looks
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:10.680]   just
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:10.970]   like

[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:12.180]  ,
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:12.180]   yeah

[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:16.040]   I
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:17.030]   think
