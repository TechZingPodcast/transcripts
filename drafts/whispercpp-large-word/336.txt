[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:16.510]   that
[01:34:16.510 --> 01:34:17.190]   happens
[01:34:17.190 --> 01:34:17.500]  .
[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:17.700]   But
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:17.730]   it
[01:34:17.730 --> 01:34:17.770]  's
[01:34:17.770 --> 01:34:18.100]   probably
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:18.300]   about
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:18.620]   money
[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:18.860]   too
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:19.100]  .
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:19.280]   My
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:19.360]   guess
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:19.440]   is
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:19.580]   they
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:19.690]   don
[01:34:19.690 --> 01:34:19.760]  't
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:19.910]   make
[01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.990]   as
[01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:20.130]   much
[01:34:20.130 --> 01:34:20.260]   off
[01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:20.590]   streaming
[01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:20.780]  .
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:21.500]   So
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:22.220]  ,
[01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:23.040]   anyway
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:23.340]  .
[01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:25.170]   All
[01:34:25.170 --> 01:34:25.200]   right
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:25.260]  .
[01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:25.520]   Well
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:25.660]  ,
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:25.900]   I
[01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:25.920]   guess
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:26.020]   you
[01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:26.150]   got
[01:34:26.150 --> 01:34:26.180]   a
[01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:26.340]   hard
[01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:26.500]   stop
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:26.590]   in
[01:34:26.590 --> 01:34:26.740]   like

[01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.320]   minutes
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:27.400]  ,
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:27.480]   so
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:27.560]   we
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:27.830]   should
[01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:28.220]   probably
[01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:28.610]   cut
[01:34:28.610 --> 01:34:30.240]   it
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:30.460]  .
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:31.580]  
[01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:31.890]   Yep
[01:34:31.890 --> 01:34:32.300]  .
[01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:32.470]   All
[01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.640]   right
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:32.780]  .

[01:34:34.090 --> 01:34:34.460]  .
[01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:36.790]   We
[01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:40.270]  're
[01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:43.480]   out
