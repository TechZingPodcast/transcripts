[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:02.640]   So
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:02.860]   it
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:02.870]   is

[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:03.860]   it
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:04.220]   basically
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:04.380]   just
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:04.590]   loads
[00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:04.660]   in

[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:06.500]  .
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.130]   But
[00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:08.040]   ultimately
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:08.080]  ,
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:08.190]   I

[00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:12.370]   actually
[00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:12.500]  ,
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:12.680]   it
