[00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.450]   in
[00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.600]   the
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.970]   morning
[00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.200]   found
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.350]   out

[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.000]  .
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.410]   But
[00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.570]   it
[00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.850]   had
[00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.040]  ,
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.250]   it
[00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.560]   had
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.930]   continued

[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.200]   of
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.560]   just
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.090]   going
[00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.450]   by
[00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.150]   rather
[00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.250]   than

[00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.430]  .
[00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.580]   So
[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.760]   it
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.360]   had

[00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.370]   So
[00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.110]   probably
[00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.420]   very

[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.420]   because
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.750]   there
[00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.940]   was
