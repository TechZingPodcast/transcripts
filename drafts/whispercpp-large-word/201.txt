[00:39:59.330 --> 00:39:59.380]  .
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:39:59.570]   And
[00:39:59.570 --> 00:39:59.630]   I
[00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.820]   did

[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:02.060]   And
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:02.280]   then
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:02.600]   after
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:02.620]   I
[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:03.210]   realized

[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:03.480]   this
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:03.590]   is
[00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:04.030]   probably
[00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.190]   not
[00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.370]   the
[00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:04.570]   best
[00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:04.750]   way
[00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:04.900]   to
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:05.190]   learn
[00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.600]   something
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:06.060]   because
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:06.260]   you
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:06.530]  're
[00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:07.280]   essentially

[00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.800]   it
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.070]   into
[00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:08.130]   a

[00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:08.600]   week
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:09.200]   period
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:09.240]  .
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:09.400]   So
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:09.720]   then
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:09.800]   I
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.360]   started
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.110]   doing
[00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:11.190]   about

[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.170]  ,
[00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:12.170]   three
[00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:12.650]   to

[00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.340]  .
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:14.470]   So
[00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.730]   sort
[00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:14.860]   of
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:15.190]   doing
[00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.320]   it
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:15.580]   over
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:15.910]   about

[00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:17.580]  .
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:17.690]   So
[00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:17.910]   that
[00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:18.110]  's

[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:20.700]  
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:21.000]   They

[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:18.460]   And
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:18.570]   then
[00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:18.820]   later
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:19.020]   when
