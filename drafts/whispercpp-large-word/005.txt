[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.000]  
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.180]   So
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.360]  ,
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.860]   Joel
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.910]  ,
[00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.180]   the

[00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.120]   solving
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.390]   was

[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.060]   I
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.370]   think
[00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.540]   you
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.780]   said
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.920]   it
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.130]   was

[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.000]  ,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.180]   so
[00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.730]   this
[00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.340]   project

[00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.340]   I
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.790]   guess
[00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.000]  ,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.180]   an
