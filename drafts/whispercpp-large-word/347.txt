[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:16.080]   At
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:16.540]   Stanford
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:16.660]   it
[00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:16.840]   was
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:17.320]   actually

[00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:23.240]   And
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:23.380]   so
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:23.520]   it
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:23.810]   just

[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:27.710]   And
[00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.790]   so
[00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:27.870]   it
[00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:28.000]   was
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:28.430]   always

[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:29.970]   And
[00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:30.280]   then
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:30.440]   a

[00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:07.300]   like
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:07.530]   code
[00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:07.720]   and
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:07.960]   then
