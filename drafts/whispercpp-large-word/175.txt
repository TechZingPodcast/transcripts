[00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.880]   the
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.040]   financial
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:04.990]   calculations
[00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.190]   were
[00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.840]   actually
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.110]   pretty
[00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.550]   difficult
[00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.670]   to
[00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:07.050]   understand
[00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:07.140]   at
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:07.360]   first
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:07.520]  .
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:07.520]  
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:07.660]   So
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.120]   there
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:08.230]   are
[00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.510]   many

[00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:08.930]   many
[00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:09.820]   iterations
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:09.930]   that
[00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:10.110]   we
[00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.280]   had

[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:11.900]   But
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.310]   ultimately
[00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.430]   we
[00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:12.800]   wrote

[00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.290]   used
[00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:14.430]   it
[00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:14.640]   and

[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:10.690]   So
[00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:10.910]   what
[00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:11.090]   was
[00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:11.260]   the

[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:12.020]  ?
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:12.140]   How
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:12.260]   did
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:12.380]   you
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:12.610]   figure
[00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:12.770]   that
[00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:13.020]   out
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:13.020]  ?
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:13.580]   Because
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:13.740]   at
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:13.980]   the
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:14.290]   time
[00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:14.460]   it
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.010]   sounded
[00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:15.540]   like
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:15.580]   the

[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:17.980]   to
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:18.300]   even
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.140]   accomplish
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:19.470]   such
[00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:19.550]   a

[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:20.750]   Yeah
[00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.860]  ,
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:21.060]   so
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:21.470]   there
[00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.880]   were

[00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:26.010]  ,
[00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:26.420]   but
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.210]   essentially
[00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:27.930]   we

[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:38.900]   They
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:39.230]   were

[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.150]   And
[00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:43.400]   so
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:43.650]   we

[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.100]   like
