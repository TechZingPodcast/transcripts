[00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:23.030]   type
[00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.150]   of
[00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:23.510]   animal

[00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:24.150]   I
[00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.410]   think

[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:26.360]  .
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:26.540]   So

[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:31.770]   it
[00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:32.280]   would
