[00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:22.660]   replication
[00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:22.920]   looked
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:23.090]   like

[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:23.780]  .
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:23.960]   But
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:24.200]   when
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:24.390]   we

[00:58:24.970 --> 00:58:25.260]   there
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:25.370]  ,
[00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:25.480]   it
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:25.670]   had

[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:27.600]   And
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:27.960]   since
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:28.250]   this
[00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:28.830]   database
[00:58:28.830 --> 00:58:28.970]   is
[00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:29.110]   so
[00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:29.400]   real
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:29.730]   time

[00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:30.640]   hours
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:30.770]   is
[00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:31.350]   actually
[00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:31.740]   quite

[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:32.950]   And
[00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:33.090]   so
[00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:33.200]   we
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:33.560]   were
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:33.910]   trying
[00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:34.050]   to
[00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:34.260]   get

[00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:34.800]   data
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:35.140]   moved
[00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:35.410]   over
[00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:35.540]  ,
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:35.820]   but
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:35.890]   it
[00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:36.100]   was
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:36.470]   taken
[00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.650]   way
[00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:36.780]  ,
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:36.990]   way
[00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:37.030]   too
[00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.650]   long
[00:58:37.650 --> 00:58:37.780]  .
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:37.780]  
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:37.970]   And
[00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:38.230]   then
[00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.690]   we
[00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:38.810]   tried
[00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:38.820]   to
[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:39.150]   bring
[00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:39.280]   it
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:39.540]   over
[00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:39.670]   in
[00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.730]   a
[00:58:39.730 --> 00:58:40.020]   big
[00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:40.250]   chunk
[00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:40.440]   and
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:40.700]   just
[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:41.090]   insert
[00:58:41.090 --> 00:58:41.310]   it
[00:58:41.310 --> 00:58:41.500]  .
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:41.810]   And
[00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:41.880]   the
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:42.450]   algorithm

[00:58:43.010 --> 00:58:43.220]  .
[00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:43.350]   So
[00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:43.480]   we
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:43.680]   had

[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:47.380]  .
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:47.530]   But
[00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:47.630]   no
[00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:48.130]   suggestion
[00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:48.430]   showed
[00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:48.530]   up
[00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.980]   because
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:49.180]   it

[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:50.580]  .
[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:50.680]   So
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:50.910]   then
[00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:50.930]   I
[00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:51.180]   had
