[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:53.020]   after
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:53.180]   you
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:53.470]   took
[00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:53.610]   the

[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:54.990]   and
[00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:55.300]   study
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:55.620]   again
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:55.890]   what
[00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:56.370]   the
[00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:56.490]   images
[00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:56.760]   were
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:57.000]  .

[00:45:59.600 --> 00:45:59.910]   images
[00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:00.150]   after
[00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.310]   you
[00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:00.550]   took
[00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.650]   the
[00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:00.850]   test
[00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:01.000]  ,
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:01.390]   that
[00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:01.980]   you
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:02.000]   did
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   better

[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:36.000]  
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:36.260]   And
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:36.590]   the
[00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:37.050]   theory
[00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:37.380]   that
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:37.740]   they
[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:38.050]   came
[00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:38.230]   up

[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:40.000]  .
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:40.610]   Because
[00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:41.380]   basically
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:42.060]   the

[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:43.700]   gave
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:44.000]   you
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:44.120]   in

[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:45.260]   you
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:45.730]   could
[00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:46.000]   travel
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:46.180]   was
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:46.480]   so
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:46.480]   big
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:46.850]   that
[00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:46.940]   it
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:47.100]   made
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:47.160]   a

[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:51.160]   and
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:51.380]   just
[00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:51.930]   completely
[00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:52.310]   changed

[00:52:59.000 --> 00:52:59.100]   I
