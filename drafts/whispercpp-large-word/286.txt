[00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:53.350]   So
[00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.740]   that
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:53.840]   really

[00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.160]   So
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:56.270]   the
[00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:56.880]   conversion
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:57.000]   was
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.300]   how
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:57.700]   many

[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.000]  
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.240]   So
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.710]   basically
[00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:06.290]   the
