[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:34.680]   operations
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:34.870]   three
[00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:35.060]   times
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:35.130]   in
[00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:35.160]   a
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:35.270]   row

[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:35.610]   And
[00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:35.870]   they
[00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:36.000]   got
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:36.440]   that
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:36.440]  .
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:36.580]   Yeah

[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:37.860]   surprisingly
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:37.960]   fast
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.120]  .
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:38.260]   So
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:38.910]   basically
[00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:39.200]   that

[00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.190]   guess

[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:42.360]  
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:42.730]   There

[00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:49.980]   was
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:50.680]   because
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:50.700]   we
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.170]   wanted

[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:54.010]   Because

[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:57.210]   it
[00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:57.540]   three

[00:29:59.320 --> 00:29:59.480]   So
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:29:59.560]   I
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:29:59.940]   think

[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:06.320]   So
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:06.400]   a
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:06.720]   card
