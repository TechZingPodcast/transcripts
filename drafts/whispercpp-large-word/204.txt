[01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:37.750]   And
[01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.810]   so
[01:22:37.810 --> 01:22:37.940]   they
[01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:38.100]   would
[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:38.230]   give
[01:22:38.230 --> 01:22:38.320]   the
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:38.520]   robot
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:38.870]   instructions
[01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:39.190]   beforehand
[01:22:39.190 --> 01:22:39.340]  .
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:39.440]   So
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:39.540]   it

[01:22:42.190 --> 01:22:42.490]   blocks
[01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:42.640]   and
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:42.820]   put
[01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:42.980]   them
[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:43.060]   in
[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:43.430]   somewhere
