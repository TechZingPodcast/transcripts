[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:36.630]   basically
[00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.980]   created
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:37.040]   a
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:37.660]   course
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:37.770]   that
[00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:37.920]   sort
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.050]   of
[00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:38.400]   seemed
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:38.460]   a
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:38.830]   little
[00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:39.040]   bit
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:39.380]   random
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:39.500]  ,
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:39.680]   but
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:39.800]   if
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:39.980]   you
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:40.530]   actually
[00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:40.960]   looked
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:40.960]   at
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.260]   it
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:41.300]   you
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:41.570]   could
[00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:41.960]   create
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:42.000]   a
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:42.490]   function
[00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:43.100]   you
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:43.160]   because
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:43.360]   the
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:43.530]   hard
[00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:43.940]   thing
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:44.130]   was
[00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:44.510]   creating
[00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:44.570]   a
[00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:45.120]   function
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:45.310]   that
[00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.630]   could
[00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:45.870]   work
[00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:46.180]   going
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:46.360]   sideways
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.090]   and
[00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:47.160]   going
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:47.290]   up
[00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:47.460]   and
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:47.770]   going
[00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:48.020]   down
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:48.200]   and
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:48.380]   all
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:48.630]   that
[00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.810]  .
[00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:48.930]   So
[00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:49.110]   the
[00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.470]   course
[00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:49.850]   looked
[00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:50.230]   random
[00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.410]  ,
[00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:50.520]   but
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:50.640]   we
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:50.890]   made
[00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:51.070]   the
[00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.190]   f
[00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.210]   we
[00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:51.620]   made
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:51.670]   it
[00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:51.740]   so
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:51.990]   that
[00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.430]   they
[00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.550]   could
[00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:52.940]   create
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:52.980]   a
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:53.490]   function
[00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:53.780]   which
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:53.870]   would
[00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:54.460]   be

[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:55.590]  .
[00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.590]   So
[00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.770]   when
[00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:55.900]   you
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:56.230]   look
[00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.390]   through
[00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:56.570]   when
[00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:56.700]   you
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:57.080]   looked
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:57.150]   over
[00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:57.280]   the

[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:57.850]   you
[00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:57.980]   you
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:58.220]   might
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:58.690]   necessarily
[00:30:58.690 --> 00:30:58.910]   think
[00:30:58.910 --> 00:30:59.090]   that
[00:30:59.090 --> 00:30:59.220]   you
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:30:59.440]   could

[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:00.330]  ,
[00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:00.360]   but
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:00.580]   then
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:00.640]   you
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:00.820]   like
[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:01.030]   when
[00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:01.130]   you
[00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:01.400]   looked
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:01.440]   a
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:01.570]   bit
[00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:01.840]   deeper
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.070]   step
[00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.200]   step
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:02.430]   jump
[00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.510]   you
[00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:02.640]   got
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:02.780]   it
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:03.380]  . [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:03.600]   We
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:03.800]   thought
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:04.000]   it
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:04.030]   was
[00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:04.260]   gonna
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:04.450]   take
[00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:04.680]   seven
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:04.910]   steps
[00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:05.060]  .
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:05.180]   The
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:05.380]   kids
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:05.520]   got
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:05.610]   it
[00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:05.800]   down
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:05.920]   to
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.080]   five
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:06.410]   because
[00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:06.630]   they
[00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:06.940]   created
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:06.970]   a
