[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:55.790]   so
[00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:56.100]   start
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:56.290]   the

[00:39:58.300 --> 00:39:58.690]   Friday
[00:39:58.690 --> 00:39:59.010]   and
[00:39:59.010 --> 00:39:59.010]  ,
[00:39:59.010 --> 00:39:59.260]   I
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:39:59.350]   did
[00:39:59.350 --> 00:39:59.520]   that
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:39:59.710]   for
[00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:00.040]   about

[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:01.470]  ,
[00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:01.730]   then
[00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:02.060]   after
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:02.120]   I
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:02.640]   realised
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.160]   that
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:03.210]   this

[00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:03.840]   probably
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:04.000]   not

[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:07.430]   essentially
[00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.840]   packing
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:07.950]   it
[00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:08.180]   into

[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:09.380]   So
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:09.710]   then
[00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.790]   I
[00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:10.360]   started

[00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:02.730]   I
[00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:03.040]   think

[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:17.230]   then
[00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.540]   later
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:17.790]   when

[00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:21.290]   and
[00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:21.600]   still
