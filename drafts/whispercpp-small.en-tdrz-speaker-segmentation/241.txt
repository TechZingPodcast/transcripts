[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.160]   anyway
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:24.400]   so
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:24.450]   we
[00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:24.690]  're

[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:26.860]   it
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:26.980]   as
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:27.220]   well
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:27.340]  ,
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:27.520]   but
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:27.780]   anyway
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:28.120]  ,
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:28.130]   um
[00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.240]   it
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:28.420]   was
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:28.540]   it
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:28.720]   was
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:28.780]   a
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:28.960]   was
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.020]   a
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:29.260]   good
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:29.870]   suggestion
[00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.980]   So
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:30.160]  .
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:30.520]   anyway
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:30.640]   we
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:30.760]  ,
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.060]   built
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:31.170]   it
[00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:31.410]   right
[00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:31.600]  ,
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:31.840]   so
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:31.900]   the
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:32.080]   way
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:32.260]   the
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:32.330]   w
[00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:32.500]   the
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.040]   algorithm
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:33.280]   that
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:33.400]   we
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:33.640]   used
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:33.760]  ,
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:33.940]   and
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:34.200]   this
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:34.380]   is
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:34.480]   the
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:34.780]   dirty
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:35.140]   little
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:35.380]   hack
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:35.500]  ,
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:35.620]   so
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.490]   basically
[00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:36.700]   obviously
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:36.820]   we
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:37.120]   these
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:37.540]   tablets
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:37.810]   may
[00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:37.840]   be

[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:39.550]   we
[00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:39.880]   needed

[00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:40.120]   be
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:40.470]   purely
[00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.780]   based
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:40.940]   on
