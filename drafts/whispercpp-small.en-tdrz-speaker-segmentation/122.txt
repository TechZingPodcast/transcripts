[00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.220]   just
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:48.330]   do
[00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:48.380]   a

[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:52.350]   only
[00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:52.350]   way
[00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:52.460]   to
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:52.570]   do
[00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:52.680]   it
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.640]  . [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:25:59.500]  
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:25:59.550]   I
[00:25:59.550 --> 00:25:59.780]  've
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:00.030]   done
[00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:00.470]   that
[00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.500]   and
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:00.630]   um
[00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.900]   that
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:01.450]   works
[00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:01.990]   relatively
[00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.190]   well
[00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.390]  .
[00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.570]   So
[00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:02.580]   I
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:02.920]   think
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:03.190]   yeah
[00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.500]   with
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.070]   something

[00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.420]   I
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:05.750]   think
[00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.950]   the
[00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:06.570]   approach
[00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:06.950]   might
[00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:07.100]   have

[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:09.580]   do
