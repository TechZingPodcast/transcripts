[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:08.840]   he
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.280]   realised
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:09.470]   that
[00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.610]   uh
[00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:09.720]   the

[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:10.950]   figured
[00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:11.310]   would
[00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:11.460]   be
