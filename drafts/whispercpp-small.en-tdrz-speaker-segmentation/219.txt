[01:46:43.610 --> 01:46:43.870]   with
[01:46:43.870 --> 01:46:44.070]   why
[01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.130]   I
[01:46:44.130 --> 01:46:44.260]   do

[01:46:44.910 --> 01:46:45.130]   and
[01:46:45.130 --> 01:46:45.630]   whatever
[01:46:45.630 --> 01:46:45.840]   but
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:46.100]   this
[01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:46.880]   is
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:46.880]   you
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:47.180]   know

[01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.740]   is
[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:47.850]   why
[01:46:47.850 --> 01:46:47.980]   this
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:48.520]   is
