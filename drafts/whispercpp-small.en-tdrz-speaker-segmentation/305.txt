[00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.660]   her
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:49.990]   idea
[00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.340]   which
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.100]   retrospect
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:51.320]   was
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:51.620]   just
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:52.020]   uh
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:52.310]   amazing
[00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:52.610]   idea
[00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:53.140]   because
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:53.300]   it
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:53.590]   made
